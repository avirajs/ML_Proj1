    "All html files are collected from the IMDb archive in the domain of movies. Each of the 30,000 documents is a review. The reviews are professionally written and are posted to different online newsgroups. Data collected by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/\n",

    "#### Purpose of the Data and Analysis\n",
    "Understanding human sentiment is an important part of businesses to understand the consumers relationship management (CRM). Since humans are verbal communicators, simple numbers are not an accurate indicator. Numeric rating systems can only describe sentiment to a certain extent and are not always available. A better approach is to understand general sentiment from the vocabulary collected in freely available reviews and posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge of sentiment can be especially beneficial when applied to movie distributers who want a deeper understanding of what qualities make a movie successful before they spend millions to distribute them through channels (either streamed or physical). This way more financially viable movies can be chosen from studios and sold based on reviews. In the end, distributers make money from lucrative movies and consumers would get what they wanted to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction Task\n",
    "The nuances can become extremely fine-grained with implict meanings such as intent, emotion, subjectivity. However, this prediction task would be a basic polarity analysis, a simple positive or negative, coupled with key words describing them, which is basically enough to take decent advantage of the wealth of data available. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Level of Accuracy\n",
    "The success of this task would result in basic classification of a review as positive or negative by analyzing vocabulary used. The level of success of this kind of classification depends on the length of the review and the complexity of the language used to describe it. Taking all this together, the required accuracy for this data classification to be of use would be around 90+ percent or above because any false classification could result in the movie not being distributed or wrongly distributed in place of a better performer, thus causing massive losses in revenue through wasted production.\n",
